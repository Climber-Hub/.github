Climber Hub
===========

This is the Climber Hub, a place to share your climbing experiences and keep track of your progress.  
Climber Hub is an open source project and non-profit organization. We are not affiliated with any climbing company.  
We are a community of climbers, for climbers.  
We are climbers, just like you.  

## What is Climber Hub?

Climber Hub is a backend service that allows you to keep track of your climbing progress and share your experiences and opinions with other climbers.  
It offers a REST API that you can use to retrieve information about gyms, routes, your progress, comments, etc.  

## How can I use it?

Climber Hub is still in early development. It doesn't have a frontend yet, but you can use the API to feed your own frontend.  
If you do develop a frontend, please let us know so we can add it to the list of available frontends.  

## How can I contribute?

Any contribution is welcome. You can contribute by developing a frontend, by developing the backend, by writing documentation, by writing tests, by reporting bugs, by suggesting new features, by suggesting improvements, etc.
